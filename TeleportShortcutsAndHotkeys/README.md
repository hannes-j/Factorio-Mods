# Teleport Shortcuts & Hotkeys
A mod for the game Factorio.

Adds shortcut bar entries to teleport the player or their vehicle to anywhere on the map. Destinations must be valid, but in "Alt-mode" (i.e. while displaying additional entity data) collisions and terrain will be ignored.

In addition, hotkeys for teleporting configurable distances in specific directions are added. These "jumps" always ignore collisions and terrain.

The final way of teleporting is by using a specific hotkey that allows to input a name as destination - it can be any map tag belonging to the own force/team. Afterwards, this can be repeated directly by pressing another hotkey.

Partially based on the mod 'Teleport Shortcut' by 'waltermundt'.
