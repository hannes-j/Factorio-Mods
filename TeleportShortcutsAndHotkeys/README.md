# Teleport Shortcuts & Hotkeys
A mod for the game Factorio.

Adds shortcut bar entries to teleport the player to anywhere on the map; they also work while driving car-based vehicles. Destinations must be valid, but in "Alt-mode" (i.e. while displaying additional entity data) collisions and terrain will be ignored.

In addition, hotkeys for teleporting configurable distances in specific directions are added. These "jumps" always ignore collisions and terrain.

The final way of teleporting is by using a specific hotkey that allows to input the name of any map tag as teleport destination. Afterwards, this can be repeated directly by pressing another hotkey.

Partially based on the mod 'Teleport Shortcut' by 'waltermundt'.
