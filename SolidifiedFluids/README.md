# Solidified Fluids
A mod for the game Factorio.

Adds technology for different recipes to convert fluids to items and to convert them back. In addition, some fluids can be transformed into other fluids in this way.
Furthermore, recipe variants for all products are added, to replace fluid ingredients with solidified fluids.

Various aspects like recipe availability and stack size can be configured via mod settings.

The mod generates recipes and items generically based on the available fluids and barreling recipes. It should be compatible with other mods that add or remove such things.
