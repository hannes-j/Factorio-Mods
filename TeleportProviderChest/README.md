# Teleport-provider logistic chest
A mod for the game Factorio.

Adds a special buffer chest that teleports items to entities within a configurable distance, whenever there are open logistic requests (e.g. from requester chests, spidertrons, or player characters).

The range limit can be removed and you can configure a distance penalty for teleporting between different surfaces/worlds.
